üö¶ SignScope: AI-Powered Traffic Sign Recognition
A modern, full-stack web application that uses a deep learning model to identify traffic signs from user-uploaded images.

Live Demo: signscope.vercel.app (Note: The backend is currently being deployed, so predictions may not be functional on the live site yet.)

‚ú® Features
Real-Time Predictions: Upload an image of a traffic sign and receive an instant classification from the Keras model.

Modern UI: A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

Dark/Light Mode: A theme toggle for user comfort, with the preference saved in their browser.

Full-Stack Architecture: Demonstrates the integration of a Python/Flask backend with a modern JavaScript frontend.
